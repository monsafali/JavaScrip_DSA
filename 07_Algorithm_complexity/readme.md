Algorithm Complexity?

Algorithm Basics;
 What is Algorithm Complexity..
time Complexity.
The time complexity in mainly calcuated by counting the number of steps to finish to execution.

Space Complexity:
space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
 Space complexiity = Auxiliary space + input size.
  Big O notation: Use to denote complexity(both)



f(n) = 5n2 + 6n + 12
